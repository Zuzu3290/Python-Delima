#Applying a digital circuitry design into a working pythoin program. 
#idea is that given the condcutor is driving the train he is to stay active. Instead of just implying  a use of one button we apply the approach of byte based encryption to verify the conductor is alive. 
# this is a case I concluded but looking to adhere to larger scope of the project. Enforcing a more versatile project to imply a bit, a bit of I guess hardware design using pyton. 
#Even though we could approach the  program using micropython, But ehh lets try to work withpythona nd then study the sematics of micropython implementation.
